//The basic layout of the hashcode problem is always the same:
//1) multiple input data sets, provided as .txt btw. .in files
//2) Implement algorithm that finds solution
//3) Submit solution as .txt file

class InputDataSet:
construct a problem data instance from filename

class OutputDataSet:
write the output data set into a file that can be uploaded to the judge system


Guidelines:
Try using primitive java data types (Array, ArrayList, ..) as much as possible to avoid dependencies (e.g. instead of declaring own classes)
Example bad:
class Pizza{
    final int slices;
}
doStuff(ArrayList<Pizza> pizzen);
Example good:
doStuff(arrayList<int> slices);
